A relaxed, creative, and community-driven hackathon format by **LXDAO**.

### ✨ Core Principles
- 🎨 **Creative-first**: Focus on ideas and experience, not prizes  
- 🌍 **Open**: Open-source, free for anyone to join or host  
- 🚫 **Non-commercial**: No mandatory sponsors, no KPI chasing

### 🎯 Purpose
Bring back the **pure joy of creation**, spark the next wave of innovation, and provide a fun, honest stage for true builders in Web3.

# EIP-7702 Casual Hackathon: Let’s Co-Create the Future of Account Abstraction

**Account Abstraction** is becoming one of the most transformative topics in the Ethereum ecosystem. The introduction of **EIP-7702** marks a pragmatic and visionary step forward in this domain.

We believe that meaningful innovation doesn’t always come from boardrooms or conference stages — it often starts with a late-night hack or a sudden spark in your code editor.

Bring your creativity, code, and maybe a cup of iced coffee — and help shape the next chapter of Account Abstraction.

## 👨‍💻 Who Should Join?

This is not a beginner bootcamp — it's a **high-bar, low-ego** hackathon built for:

- Protocol Engineers  
- Solidity / Vyper Developers  
- Wallet Builders  
- Security Researchers  
- Anyone deeply curious about Account Abstraction

If you’re ready to:

- Read and challenge an EIP  
- Translate abstract concepts into real code  
- Join deep global conversations in the midnight dev lounge  

**This hackathon is for you.**


## 🧩 Why 7702? Why Now?

**EIP-7702**, proposed by Vitalik and others, addresses key limitations of **EIP-3074** while preserving its core strength: temporarily turning EOAs into smart accounts.

Key benefits:

- ✅ **Backwards-compatible** (works alongside ERC-4337)
- ✅ **Highly extensible** (supports custom validation logic)
- ✅ **Improved security model** (avoids permanent delegation risks)

This isn’t just a fix — it’s a new design space for wallets, dApps, security, identity, and permissions.

**Now** is the time to build, test, question, and innovate — hands-on, from the ground up.
